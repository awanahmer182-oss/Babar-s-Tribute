                        Babar Azam, born on 15 October 1994 in Lahore, grew up surrounded by cricket and dreamed of representing Pakistan from childhood. Inspired by his cousins in the Akmal family, he joined a cricket academy and quickly became known for his focus, discipline, and elegant batting technique. His early success in Under-19 cricket, including captaining Pakistan in the 2012 World Cup, made him one of the country's most promising young players.

                        Babar made his international debut in 2015 and soon impressed the world with his consistency. His real breakthrough came in 2016 when he scored three consecutive ODI centuries, establishing himself as Pakistan's new batting star. His performances in the 2019 Cricket World Cup, where he became Pakistan's highest run-scorer in the tournament's history, further strengthened his status as a world-class player.

                    <p>
                        As captain from 2019 to 2023, Babar led Pakistan to several major achievements, including reaching the T20 World Cup final in 2022 and becoming the No.1 ODI batsman in the world. Known for his perfect cover drive, calm personality, and reliability at the crease, he has become the backbone of Pakistan's batting in all formats. Even after stepping down from captaincy, Babar continues to be one of the top batsmen in international cricket and remains a major inspiration for young cricketers across Pakistan.
